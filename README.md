🧠 Computer Vision Internship 2025

This repository contains all tasks and projects completed as part of the **Winter Internship 2025** in the **Computer Vision** domain.  
The internship focuses on solving real-world problems using **pretrained deep learning models** such as **YOLOv8**, and tools like **OpenCV** and **FFmpeg**.  

Each task folder includes:
- 📓 Jupyter Notebooks  
- 📝 Documentation (README.md)  
- 🖼️ Sample outputs / result files

 📘 Overview of Tasks


 **Task 1** YOLOv8 Installation & Test - Installed the Ultralytics package, tested object detection and segmentation on a sample image. 
 
 **Task 2**  Multi-Image Detection & Metrics Evaluation - Performed batch object detection and segmentation on multiple images; evaluated model metrics like precision, recall, and mAP. 
 
 **Task 3**  Video Frame Processing - Extracted frames from a video using FFmpeg, applied YOLOv8 detection, and reassembled the processed frames into a new output video.
